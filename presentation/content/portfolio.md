# Kevin Deras – CSC 640 Portfolio

This page highlights the main pieces of my work for this course.

## REST API Projects

### Project 1 – PHP REST API

- Student Management REST API using plain PHP + PDO.
- Implemented CRUD for students, courses, and enrollments.
- Secured endpoints with a simple Bearer token.
- Tested all endpoints with Postman.

### Project 2 – Laravel Migration

- Migrated the Student Management REST API to **Laravel 10**.
- Replaced raw PDO queries with **Eloquent ORM**.
- Implemented **Laravel Sanctum** for token-based authentication.
- Used **migrations** for students, courses, and enrollments tables.
- Added Docker/Sail setup plus `run.sh` and `setup.sh` scripts.

## Deployment & Tooling

- Docker and Docker Compose for local development.
- Shell scripts for one-command startup.
- Hugo static site (this site) as documentation and portfolio.
- GitHub repository and GitHub Pages for hosting.
